# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy your React Shopping Cart application to GitHub Pages.

## ✅ Setup Complete

The following configurations have been added to enable GitHub Pages deployment:

### 1. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)
- ✅ Static export enabled (`output: 'export'`)
- ✅ Base path configured for GitHub Pages (`/shopping-cart`)
- ✅ Asset prefix configured
- ✅ Image optimization disabled for static export
- ✅ ESLint/TypeScript errors ignored for build

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- ✅ Automated deployment on push to `main` branch
- ✅ Runs tests before deployment
- ✅ Builds static export
- ✅ Deploys to GitHub Pages

### 3. Static Files
- ✅ `.nojekyll` file added to prevent Jekyll processing
- ✅ Dynamic routes configured with `generateStaticParams`

## 🛠️ Manual Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/viniciustrindade/shopping-cart
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. The workflow will automatically run and deploy your site

### Step 3: Access Your Live Site
After deployment completes, your site will be available at:
**https://viniciustrindade.github.io/shopping-cart/**

## 🔄 Automatic Deployment

Once set up, the site will automatically redeploy whenever you:
- Push changes to the `main` branch
- Merge pull requests into `main`

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

- [x] Next.js configured for static export
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow created
- [x] Dynamic routes configured with generateStaticParams
- [x] Build tested locally (successful)
- [x] Static files generated in `out/` directory
- [x] README updated with live demo link

## 🎯 Live Demo Links

- **Live Site**: https://viniciustrindade.github.io/shopping-cart/
- **Repository**: https://github.com/viniciustrindade/shopping-cart

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Review the build logs for errors
3. Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
4. Verify the `out/` directory contains the built files

### If pages don't load correctly:
1. Check that the base path is correctly configured
2. Verify image paths are working with unoptimized images
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## 📝 Notes

- The site uses static generation, so all product pages (1-20) are pre-built
- API calls to Fake Store API work from the client side
- All tests pass before deployment
- The deployment includes all screenshots and documentation

Your React Shopping Cart is now ready for live demonstration! 🎉
