Overview
React Coding Challenge (Shopping Cart)

Objective

The goal of this challenge is to correctly assess your knowledge of React and your approach to componentizing the proposed solution. It is important that you apply your best practices, and if you make any decisions that deviate from standard practices, please explain why. Additionally, we will positively value the creation of unit tests.

‚∏ª

Instructions

You are required to build a shopping store using React with Next.js as the framework.
üîó Visit: https://nextjs.org/

To display products, use the following API:
üîó https://fakestoreapi.com/products

We also provide the design of two of the three screens to be implemented.
We expect you to faithfully reproduce the design without getting caught up in minor details.

‚∏ª

Main Page

On the home page, you will find:
	‚Ä¢	A header with:
	‚Ä¢	Logo
	‚Ä¢	Search bar
	‚Ä¢	Badge/icon showing the number of items in the cart
	‚Ä¢	Product cards displaying:
	‚Ä¢	Title
	‚Ä¢	Description
	‚Ä¢	Price
	‚Ä¢	Action button to add the product to the cart

Each time a product is added to the cart:
	‚Ä¢	Update the global cart quantity displayed in the header
	‚Ä¢	Synchronize the cart content with the Shopping Cart view

Additionally:
	‚Ä¢	The search bar filters products already loaded on the page
	‚Ä¢	Implement a ‚ÄúSee More‚Äù button to request more products (local pagination)
	‚Ä¢	By default, only 3 products (one row) should be displayed

‚∏ª

Shopping Cart Page

The user will navigate to the shopping cart view by clicking the cart icon.

This page should display:
	‚Ä¢	Product title
	‚Ä¢	Product quantity
	‚Ä¢	Total amount

Include a ‚ÄúContinue Shopping‚Äù button to return to the main page.

‚∏ª

Product Details Page

Design and develop a user-friendly product details page that displays:
	‚Ä¢	Image
	‚Ä¢	Title
	‚Ä¢	Description
	‚Ä¢	Price
	‚Ä¢	Ability to add product to cart

This layout should be:
	‚Ä¢	Clean and intuitive
	‚Ä¢	Support responsive design
	‚Ä¢	Consistent with the overall UI
	‚Ä¢	Optimized for readability and engagement

‚∏ª

Important Considerations

You‚Äôll need to make the following technical decisions:
	‚Ä¢	How to manage application state (products, cart, added items, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Choice of styling framework (SASS, LESS, Styled Components, Tailwind, Pure CSS, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	How to keep the main page updated with the latest products
	‚Ä¢	How to handle errors and communicate them to the user
	‚Ä¢	Use of custom hooks (if necessary)
	‚Ä¢	Implementation of local pagination
	‚Ä¢	Creation of unit tests for key components
	‚Ä¢	Feel free to use AI-assisted tools to complete the challenge

Some UX aspects were intentionally left vague ‚Äî we encourage you to identify and implement at least one improvement.
