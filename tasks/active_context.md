# Active Context - React Shopping Cart Project

## Current Status
- **Project Phase**: Planning & Architecture
- **Timeline**: 72 hours deadline
- **Estimated Development Time**: 2-3 hours for MVP, +1 hour for polish

## Active Requirements
1. **Primary Goal**: Build functional shopping cart using React/Next.js
2. **API Integration**: Fake Store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/products)
3. **Core Features**:
   - Product listing with search and pagination
   - Shopping cart with add/remove functionality
   - Product details page
   - Responsive design
   - Unit testing

## Current Project State
- ✅ Next.js 15.4.6 with React 19.1.0 setup complete
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v4 configured
- ✅ TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- ✅ Project documentation exists (architecture, PRD, technical specs)
- ❌ No implementation started - default Next.js template active

## Key Decisions Made
1. **State Management**: React Context API with useReducer
2. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (already configured)
3. **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
4. **Persistence**: localStorage for cart state
5. **UX Enhancement**: Toast notifications for user feedback

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Install missing dependencies (testing libraries, utility packages)
2. Set up project structure with components, hooks, context
3. Implement core cart functionality
4. Build main pages (Home, Cart, Product Details)
5. Add testing suite
6. Polish UX and responsive design

## Blockers & Risks
- **Risk**: API rate limiting from Fake Store API
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper caching and error handling
- **Risk**: Time constraint (72 hours)
- **Mitigation**: Focus on MVP first, then enhancements

## Success Metrics
- ✅ All three pages functional
- ✅ Cart operations work correctly
- ✅ Responsive design on mobile/desktop
- ✅ Unit tests pass for core components
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code structure
